{"name":"Cheminv","tagline":"Web-Based Chemical Inventory System","body":"### Cheminv - An open-source chemical inventory system.\r\n\r\nCheminv organizes chemicals by their location in a lab.  Locations are included in a MySQL database, and the home page provides the ability to sort chemicals by location.  You can also search the database by terms such as chemical name or CAS number.  The home page provides links to add new chemicals to the database, a shopping list that contains chemicals that have been requested, and a project based listing of chemicals that are in use.  You can also export the entire database as a cvs file, and view chemicals that have been used in the past (Archived Chemicals).\r\n\r\n![Overview Image](http://www.aminodesigns.com/images/overview_s.png)\r\n\r\nEach chemical has a page with pertinent information, such as the quantity, manufacturer, CAS number, amount, dates, bar codes, and much more.  On the item page users can also indicate that more of a chemical is required, which automatically adds the chemical to a list to be ordered.  \r\n\r\n![Chemical Image](http://www.aminodesigns.com/images/chemical.png)\r\n\r\nThe page for adding new chemicals includes fields for all the options above.\r\n\r\n![Add Chemicals](http://www.aminodesigns.com/images/add_chemical.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCheminv was created by Thomas Morrell for the Haw Yang Lab at Princeton University\r\n\r\nCheminv is based on ecDB [www.ecDB.net](http://www.ecdb.net), which was created by [Nils Fredriksson](http://nilsf.se) aka. @ElectricMan and designed by [Buildlog](http://buildlog.se). \r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n- Download the latest stable release from the [download page](https://github.com/tmorrell/cheminv/downloads).\r\n- Create a MySQL database. (mysql -p -e create database cheminv)\r\n- Import `cheminv.sql` database structure to your MySQL-database. (mysql -p cheminv < cheminv.sql)\r\n- Make sure you can access the database (mysql -p grant alter,create,delete,drop,insert,update,select,index ON cheminv.* TO 'cheminvuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';) \r\n- Insert your MySQL data in the configuration files, `include/mysql_connect.php` and 'include/login/config.php'.\r\n- **You are now set to go!** The default username and password should automatically be entered.\r\n\r\n- You'll want to edit locations to match your lab setup.  The easiest way in to\r\n  install mysql-workbench and edit table data.  Select cheminv and the\r\ncategory_head or category_sub tables\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n-  Web Server.\r\n-  PHP Version 5.2.4 or above.\r\n-  MySQL Version 5.0 or above.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\ncheminv is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code\r\nand documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form\r\nof Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on\r\nthe [cheminv repository](https://github.com/tmorrell/cheminv) on GitHub.\r\n\r\nIssues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation\r\nerror in cheminv then please check a few things first:\r\n\r\n- There is not already an open Issue\r\n- The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for\r\n  closed Issues)\r\n- Is it something really obvious that you fix it yourself?\r\n\r\nReporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull\r\nRequest, which is done by \"Forking\" the main repository and committing to your\r\nown copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.\r\n\r\nOne thing at a time: A pull request should only contain one change. That does\r\nnot mean only one commit, but one change - however many commits it took. The\r\nreason for this is that if you change X and Y but send a pull request for both\r\nat the same time, we might really want X but disagree with Y, meaning we\r\ncannot merge the request. Using the Git-Flow branching model you can create\r\nnew branches for both of these features and send two requests.","google":"UA-62974646-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
